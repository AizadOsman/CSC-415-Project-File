	cout<<" <--- OVERVIEW OF ME --->" <<endl;
	cout<<" My name is Muhammad Aizad Bin Osman. I lived in Rawang hometown.\n";
	cout<<" I am 21 years old and was born in Hospital Selayang on 22 August 2001.\n";
	cout<<" During my leisure time, I always spend it watching movies and series on several streaming platform such as Netfilx and Disney+.\n";
	cout<<" Unfortunately, I am a carrier of minor thalassemia which makes my body prone to colds and frequent sneezing.\n";
	cout<<" However, I already know my body well making me more alert when in the cold.\n" <<endl <<endl;
	
	cout<<" As a normal human-being, I also easily feel restless and nervous especially when I am facing a big examination or when I am in a situation I have never faced before.\n";
	cout<<" When I experience such anxiety, I can't eat as the restlessness stifles my hunger and appetite.\n";
	cout<<" Usually in this case, I will try to calm myself down by taking a deep breath and trying to clear my mind about things that are worrying.\n";
	cout<<" Although I often experience that anxiety, I still feel grateful that I am now able to calm down even in a tiring situation and increased stress.\n"; 
	cout<<" Thanks to some tiring situations I've always faced in the past.\n" <<endl <<endl;
	
	

	cout<<" <--- EDUCATION BACKGROUND --->" <<endl;
	cout<<" When I was 7 years old, I used to study at SK Rawang, a school located near my house.\n";
	cout<<" Later, I continued my studies at Sekolah Agama Menengah Rawang (SAM Rawang) where I studied in accounting, economics and also additional mathematics.\n";
	cout<<" Honestly, I was not interested and had no expertise in additional math subjects. However, I feel very grateful for successfully passing the subject during the SPM examination.\n"<<endl <<endl;
	
	cout<<" After completing the secondary school examination (SPM), I continued my studies at the Diploma level at UiTM Rembau as determined by the UPU results.\n";
	cout<<" During my diploma, I studied in the information management course where it focused on the management of resource centers, libraries, archives and even museums.\n";
	cout<<" I had so much fun while learning through this course as it was not as difficult as I thought to absorb all the knowledge and information about this course.\n"<<endl <<endl;
	
	cout<<" Currently, I am a student in information technology course at UiTM Shah Alam.\n";
	cout<<" I hope I can learn more about the field as I am very interested in this course.\n";
	cout<<" Apart from that, I also hope that I can make my parents happy with the excellent results that I will achieve in the future.\n";
